\section{Introduction}
The introduction should start with a general discussion about the heart and its importance to overall health. Then, it should narrow down to the specifics of heartbeat monitoring, highlighting its significance in clinical diagnosis. 

The role and potential of machine learning (ML) in enhancing our understanding and interpretation of ECG data should be introduced, with an emphasis on how ML algorithms can automate the classification of heartbeats into normal or various abnormal conditions. 

This section should also provide a brief survey of what has been done in the field of ML for heartbeat classification, identifying gaps that your work aims to fill.

\subsection{Heart and its Importance}
Explain the fundamental aspects of the heart's function and its critical role in human health.

\subsection{Heartbeat Monitoring in Clinical Diagnosis}
Discuss how heartbeat monitoring is used in clinical settings, its importance, and what it can reveal about cardiac health.

\subsection{Machine Learning in Heartbeat Classification}
Introduce the concept of machine learning, its relevance to data analysis, and why it is particularly suited to ECG heartbeat classification.

\subsection{Survey of Machine Learning Approaches for Heartbeat Classification}
Provide an overview of existing research in the field, highlighting significant achievements and identifying any limitations or gaps your research aims to address.

\section{Problem Statement}
Clearly state the problem you are addressing in your research. This should include the specific challenges in ECG heartbeat classification that your study aims to overcome, the significance of solving these challenges, and how your approach differs from or improves upon existing methods.

\section{Methodology}
\textit{This section should detail the methodology you've used in your research, including data collection, preprocessing, the specific machine learning algorithms applied, and any novel techniques or approaches you've developed.}

\section{Results}
\textit{Present the results of your study, including any quantitative evaluations, comparisons to existing methods, and any insights gained from the analysis.}

\section{Discussion}
\textit{Discuss the implications of your findings, potential applications, and any limitations or areas for future research.}
